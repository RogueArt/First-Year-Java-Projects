# About

This repo contains most of the Java projects that I did in my AP Computer Science course. The quality of the code may vary as these are samples from when I first began coding. All examples contain README.md files explaining the scope of the project. Not all samples are guaranteed to compile as some of these were left in an unfinished state.

# Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/RogueArt/First-Year-Java-Projects.git
```
2. Install needed libraries, these can be found in the README.md for each folder
